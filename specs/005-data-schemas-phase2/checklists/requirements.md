# Specification Quality Checklist: Data Schemas

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-12
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

| Category | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Content Quality | PASS | All items verified |
| Requirement Completeness | PASS | 15 functional requirements, all testable |
| Feature Readiness | PASS | 4 user stories covering core flows |

## Notes

- Spec is complete and ready for `/sp.plan` phase
- No clarifications needed - standard database schema patterns applied
- Clear boundaries: User and Task entities only (no tags, due dates, priorities)
- Assumptions documented for decisions like UUID keys, UTC timestamps
